- **Multi-agent orchestration** with `spawn_agent` tool for hierarchical delegation to specialist subagents.
- **OpenAI-compatible provider** for third-party APIs (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, vLLM, LiteLLM).
- **Multi-provider failover** with automatic retry across configured fallback models.
- **Lifecycle hook system** — `beforeToolCall`, `onMessage`, `onSessionStart` extensibility points.
- **Stuck loop detection** — prevents infinite tool-call loops by detecting repeated identical calls (configurable `max_tool_repeats`).

- **xAI provider support** (`xai/*`, `grok-*`) with native `web_search` tool passthrough.
- **Vertex AI provider** — access Claude and Gemini models via Google Cloud with service account authentication (`vertex/*` models).
- **Gemini API key provider** — simple `GEMINI_API_KEY` authentication without OAuth (`gemini/*` models).
- **Bridge health monitoring** — automatic health status tracking (healthy/degraded/unhealthy) for all connected bridges.
- **CLI bridge** (`localgpt-bridge-cli`) — interactive terminal that connects to a running daemon via bridge IPC socket.
- **Skill routing rules** — `useWhen` and `dontUseWhen` conditions for context-aware skill activation.
- **Temporal decay for memory search** — optional scoring penalty for older memories (`temporal_decay_lambda` config).
- **LLM reasoning text preservation** — thinking/reasoning content emitted alongside tool calls is now preserved in responses.

### Changed

- **Actor-based agent execution** with `Arc<MemoryManager>` for improved thread safety.
- **`web_fetch` extraction upgraded** to use the `readability` crate with fallback text sanitization.
- **BridgeManager moved** from core to server crate for cleaner dependency graph.
- **Model routing updated** to support Claude 4.6 models.
- Replaced unsafe string byte-slicing with `floor_char_boundary` to prevent UTF-8 panics.
- Config templates expanded with `providers.xai`, `[tools.web_search]`, `[cron]`, and `[mcp]` examples.

### Fixed
