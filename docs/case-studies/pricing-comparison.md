## What You Get for Free with LocalGPT Gen

LocalGPT Gen ships as a single open-source binary (Apache 2.0) with no subscription, no API keys required for core generation, and no usage caps:

- **84 MCP tools** covering world creation, scene management, lighting, materials, audio, behaviors, avatars, camera control, export, and multi-file code generation
- **5 genre starter templates** -- medieval village (38 entities), space station (36), island paradise (35), dungeon crawler (40), zen garden (38) -- each with full world definitions and skill descriptions
- **Compliance metadata** built into every generated world (regulatory attribution, tool provenance, generation timestamps)
- **HTTP transport** for remote MCP access -- connect from Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client
- **Avatar system** with first-person and third-person camera modes
- **Procedural audio** with spatial emitters, ambient layers, and volume falloff
- **7 entity behaviors** (orbit, bob, rotate, patrol, follow, wander, pulse) attachable to any entity
- **Multi-file code generation** -- outputs complete Cargo project structure (main.rs, world.ron, Cargo.toml) ready to `cargo run`

All of the above is open source. You own the generated code, can version-control it, modify it, and ship it commercially with no royalty or revenue share.

## Cost Per World

| Tool | Cost for 1 World | Cost for 100 Iterations | Cost for 1,000 Iterations |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **LocalGPT Gen** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Project Genie** | $250/month (unlimited within subscription, but each world lasts 60 seconds) | $250/month | $250/month |
| **World Labs Marble** (standard) | $1.20 | $120.00 | $1,200.00 |
| **World Labs Marble** (draft) | $0.12 | $12.00 | $120.00 |
| **Roblox 4D Gen** | $0 (platform-locked output) | $0 (platform-locked output) | $0 (platform-locked output) |
| **ASI World** | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |

**Note on LocalGPT Gen costs:** Core world generation (placing primitives, configuring lighting, adding behaviors, exporting code) requires no API calls and costs $0. If you choose to use an external LLM to drive the MCP tools (e.g., Claude, GPT, or a local model via Ollama), LLM inference costs are separate and user-controlled. Running a local model (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) via Ollama eliminates even that cost.

**Note on Project Genie:** The $250/month Google AI Ultra subscription includes access to Project Genie along with other Google AI services. Worlds are generated in real-time as you navigate (compute runs continuously during exploration) and are limited to 60 seconds at 720p resolution.

**Note on Roblox 4D Gen:** While the tool itself is free within Roblox Studio, generated objects only exist inside the Roblox platform. You cannot export them as standard 3D files or source code. The 160,000+ objects generated during early access all remain Roblox-only.

## Hidden Costs of Competitors

### Cloud Dependency

Every competitor except LocalGPT Gen requires an active internet connection and cloud compute. Project Genie generates worlds frame-by-frame on Google's servers. World Labs processes generation requests via their API. Roblox 4D runs on Roblox infrastructure. If the service goes down, rate-limits you, or shuts down, your workflow stops. LocalGPT Gen runs on the hardware you already own.

### Vendor Lock-In

- **Project Genie** worlds exist only as neural video frames in Google's system. There is no export to standard 3D formats. When you stop paying, you lose access.
- **World Labs Marble** outputs Gaussian splats and meshes viewable in their hosted environment. Mesh export is available but the editing tools (Chisel, Composer) are cloud-only.
- **Roblox 4D** objects are locked to the Roblox platform. The Cube Foundation Model's output schemas (Car-5, Body-1) produce Roblox-native objects with no standard format export.
- **ASI World** produces Tencent-proprietary pipeline artifacts. The GDC 2026 demo showed no standard export path.

LocalGPT Gen outputs standard Rust source code. The generated `world.ron` files are human-readable text. The Cargo project compiles with standard `cargo build`. You can check it into git, diff it, code-review it, and extend it with arbitrary Rust/Bevy code.

### No Source Code Access

None of the competitors provide source code output. Project Genie outputs video frames. World Labs outputs 3D scene files. Roblox outputs platform objects. ASI World outputs pipeline artifacts. In all cases, the generation logic is opaque -- you cannot inspect, modify, or learn from how the world was constructed.

LocalGPT Gen's output is the construction itself: named entities with explicit positions, materials, lights, behaviors, and audio emitters, all in readable RON format backed by Bevy ECS components.

### Usage Caps and Metering

- **World Labs** charges per generation. At $1.20/world, a developer iterating 100 times on a scene pays $120 in API costs alone.
- **Project Genie** caps worlds at 60 seconds and 720p. No workaround exists for longer or higher-resolution worlds.
- **Roblox 4D** is limited to two generation schemas (Car-5 and Body-1). Open vocabulary schemas are announced but not yet available.

LocalGPT Gen has no generation limits. Iterate as many times as you want. Compile at your GPU's native resolution. Run at whatever framerate your hardware supports.

### No Offline Mode

All competitors require internet access for every generation. LocalGPT Gen can run entirely offline when paired with a local LLM (Ollama + Llama/Qwen/Mistral). The MCP tools operate without any network calls.

## When Competitors Make Sense

Competitors are not universally worse -- they serve different needs:

- **Project Genie** is compelling for rapid visual prototyping when you want photorealistic environments immediately and don't need editable code output. If your workflow is "explore a visual concept in 60 seconds" rather than "build a game," Genie delivers faster visual fidelity than primitives-based generation.

- **World Labs Marble** suits workflows that need 3D scene assets (Gaussian splats, meshes) for integration into existing Unreal/Unity/Blender pipelines. The multimodal input (text, images, panoramas, video) is broader than LocalGPT Gen's current text-only input. At $0.12/draft, quick concept exploration is affordable for well-funded teams.

- **Roblox 4D Gen** makes sense if you are already building within the Roblox ecosystem and targeting Roblox's 330M+ monthly active users. The 64% playtime increase during the 4D beta demonstrates genuine user engagement. Platform lock-in is acceptable when the platform is your target audience.

- **ASI World** targets large studio production pipelines where Tencent's full-stack approach (narrative, scene, and asset generation in one pass) could accelerate professional game development. Not yet available externally.

- **Non-technical users** who want visual results without installing Rust, running a compiler, or understanding ECS architecture will find cloud tools more accessible. LocalGPT Gen's output is source code -- that is its strength for developers and its barrier for non-developers.

| **Works offline** | Yes | No |
| **Iteration cost** | $0 per iteration (edit code, recompile) | $0.12 -- $1.20 per generation (World Labs) or subscription-gated |
| **Platform lock-in** | None (standard Rust/Bevy) | Google, World Labs, Roblox, or Tencent ecosystem |
| **Steam compliance** | Code tools are exempt from AI disclosure requirements | Generated content must disclose AI use (8,000+ games affected in H1 2025) |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 -- use commercially with no royalty | Proprietary terms, subject to change |
