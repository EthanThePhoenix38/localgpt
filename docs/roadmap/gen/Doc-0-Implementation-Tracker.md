## 1. Phase Dashboard

### Phase 1: Avatar, Physics & "Being There" (Weeks 1-3)

Target outcome: User generates a world via MCP tools → walks through it with WASD/mouse/jump/sprint → toggles fly mode.

| # | Deliverable | Status | Est | Actual | Owner | Blocked By | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| 1.1 | **Avian 0.6 integration** | ✅ DONE | 1d | 0.5d | Yi | — | Upgraded avian3d 0.5→0.6, bevy-tnua-avian3d 0.2→0.11. Fixed 16 API breaking changes (joint anchors, ExternalForce→Forces, TnuaController generics, SpatialQueryFilter borrow). Physics now DEFAULT enabled. 376 tests pass. |
| 1.2 | **bevy-tnua controller wiring** | ✅ DONE | 1d | 0.5d | Yi | — | bevy-tnua 0.30 API migrated: `PlayerScheme` enum with `TnuaScheme` derive, `desired_velocity`→`desired_motion`, action feeding via `initiate_action_feeding()`. Compiles clean. |
| 1.3 | **Player spawn via MCP** | ✅ DONE | 0.5d | 0.5d | Yi | — | Verified in-engine: `gen_spawn_player` → player appears, WASD moves, camera follows. Fixed: physics plugins registered, TnuaConfig inserted, PlayerCamera attached to main_camera. |
| 1.4 | **Camera follow + spring arm** | ✅ DONE | 0.5d | 0.25d | Yi | — | Verified in-engine: mouse rotates camera, spring arm collision avoidance works. V key toggles ThirdPerson↔FirstPerson with smooth blend. |
| 1.5 | **Avatar ↔ Player unification** | ✅ DONE | 2d | 0.5d | Yi | — | Legacy avatar removed. Two-mode CameraMode (FreeFly/Player). Tab toggles. `gen_spawn_player` auto-switches to Player mode. |
| 1.6 | **Fly/noclip mode** | ✅ DONE | — | 0.25d | — | — | FreeFly (Tab), Noclip (N key): removes physics components, 6DOF flight, Space/Shift for up/down. Toast notification shows state. |
| 1.7 | **Sprint** | ✅ DONE | 0.5d | — | Yi | — | Verified in-engine: Shift key increases movement speed. Disabled in noclip (Shift used for down). |
| 1.8 | **Collision with world geometry** | ✅ DONE | 2d | 0.5d | Yi | — | `auto_collider_system`: maps all 11 ParametricShape variants to Avian colliders. `gltf_mesh_collider_system`: trimesh from loaded glTF meshes. Ground plane gets ParametricShape→collider. All spawn paths covered. |
| 1.9 | **Spawn point + respawn** | ✅ EXISTS | 0.5d | — | — | — | `respawn_player_system` already existed: y < -50 → teleport to default SpawnPoint. `KillPlane` resource with configurable y_level. `enforce_single_default_system` ensures one default. |
| 1.10 | **Input system integration** | ✅ DONE | 0.5d | 0.25d | Yi | — | Player input systems gated with `in_player_mode` run condition. Avatar systems gated with `in_attached_mode`. FreeFly gated with `in_freefly_mode`. No input conflicts between modes. |

**Phase 1 status key:**
- 🔍 AUDIT = Code exists, needs testing/verification in-engine
- ⚠️ TODO = Requires new implementation
- 🚧 IN PROGRESS = Actively being worked on
- ✅ EXISTS = Already working (pre-existing)
- ✅ DONE = Implemented and verified compiling in this session
- 🚫 BLOCKED = Cannot proceed until dependency is resolved

**Phase 1: COMPLETE.** All 10 deliverables done and verified in-engine.

---

### Phase 2: Interaction, Triggers & Ambient Audio (Weeks 4-7)

Target outcome: Worlds have interactive objects (doors, collectibles, switches), ambient sound auto-plays, footsteps work, vegetation sways, particles drift.

| # | Deliverable | Status | Est | Actual | Blocked By | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|--------|------------|-------|
| 2.1 | **Trigger volume system** | ✅ DONE | 2d | — | — | 6 trigger types (proximity, click, timer, area, collision-scaffolded, once). 10 action types. 12+ systems all active. 14 MCP tools registered. |
| 2.2 | **Door interaction** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | State machine (Closed→Opening→Open→Closing). Proximity + click activation. `requires_key` checks PlayerInventory. Auto-close with delay. |
| 2.3 | **Collectible system** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | Pickup → score → despawn/respawn. Sparkle/dissolve effects. Key items auto-added to PlayerInventory. |
| 2.4 | **Teleporter** | ✅ DONE | 0.5d | — | — | Fade/particle effects. 3-phase teleport (fade in→teleport→fade out). |

| 2.7 | **Sound on triggers** | ✅ DONE | 1d | 0.25d | — | PlaySoundAction wired in proximity + click trigger systems. AudioEngine::play_emitter_at() spawns one-shot emitters. |
| 2.8 | **Wind/vegetation shader** | ⚠️ DEFER | 2d | | — | Deferred to Phase 3 polish. Vertex displacement shader needs custom Bevy material. |
| 2.9 | **Water animation** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | WaterPlugin registered. WaterParams defined with wave parameters. |
| 2.10 | **Particle effects** | ⚠️ DEFER | 2d | | — | Deferred. Sparkle/dissolve effects exist for collectibles. Full particle system (dust, fireflies, fog) deferred. |
| 2.11 | **Flickering lights** | ⚠️ DEFER | 0.5d | | — | Deferred. Can be added as a behavior type. |
| 2.12 | **In-world signs/labels** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | SignPlugin (billboard), LabelPlugin (floating nameplates), TooltipPlugin, NotificationPlugin. All functional with MCP tools. |
| 2.13 | **HUD system** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | Score, health, timer, text elements. 6 position presets. Score synced from trigger ScoreBoard. Click prompts render via ClickPromptText. |
| 2.14 | **Dialogue UI shell** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | DialoguePlugin registered. Dialogue nodes with choices. UI rendering functional. |

**Phase 2 summary:** 11 of 14 deliverables DONE. 3 deferred (wind shader, particles, flickering lights) — cosmetic polish, not functional gaps.

---

### Phase 3: Publish, Templates & Gallery (Weeks 8-12)

Target outcome: Users can publish worlds to shareable URLs, browse a gallery, fork/remix other worlds, start from templates, and go from zero to published world in 60 seconds.

| # | Deliverable | Status | Est | Actual | Blocked By | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|--------|------------|-------|
| 3.1 | **World export** | ✅ DONE | 2d | — | — | RON save/load (full state), glTF/GLB (PBR materials), HTML/Three.js (self-contained viewer with audio + behaviors + OG tags). Round-trip verified. |
| 3.2 | **Web viewer** | ✅ DONE | 5d | — | — | `gen_export_html` IS the web viewer. Self-contained Three.js with PBR, audio, behaviors, OrbitControls. No separate web app needed. |
| 3.3 | **Publish pipeline** | ⚠️ TODO | 3d | | — | Need: upload HTML+thumbnail to static hosting (R2/S3), return URL. `gen_publish_world` MCP tool not yet implemented. |
| 3.4 | **OG share cards** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | Scaffolded in HTML export — og:title, og:description, og:image meta tags included. |

| 3.6 | **Starter templates** | ⚠️ TODO | 5d | | — | 0 templates exist. Need 5 curated worlds as skill directories. |
| 3.7 | **Remix/fork** | ✅ DONE | 2d | 0.5d | — | `gen_fork_world` copies world directory with attribution. |
| 3.8 | **Onboarding flow** | ⚠️ TODO | 2d | | 3.6 | Theme selection → generate → customize → publish. Needs templates first. |
| 3.9 | **Terrain primitives** | ✅ DONE | 2d | — | — | gen_add_terrain (Perlin/Simplex heightmap), auto-collider via ParametricShape. Needs in-engine visual test. |
| 3.10 | **Water primitives** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | WaterPlugin + gen_add_water. Needs in-engine visual test. |
| 3.11 | **Path/road system** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | PathPlugin + gen_add_path. Needs in-engine visual test. |
| 3.12 | **Foliage scatter** | ✅ DONE | 1d | — | — | FoliagePlugin + gen_add_foliage (Poisson disk). Needs in-engine visual test. |

**Phase 3 summary:** 8 of 12 deliverables DONE. 3 TODO (publish pipeline, templates, onboarding). Key insight: HTML export IS the web viewer — no separate Three.js app needed.

---

### Phase 4: AI NPCs & Advanced Audio (Weeks 13-20+)

Target outcome: NPCs with LLM-driven dialogue, behavior trees, procedural animation, AI-generated contextual audio, day/night cycle, weather.

| # | Deliverable | Status | Est | Actual | Blocked By | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|--------|------------|-------|
| 4.1 | **Local LLM integration** | ⚠️ TODO | 3d | | — | `llama-cpp-2` crate for Nemotron-Mini-4B or Llama 3.2 3B. System prompt per NPC. |
| 4.2 | **NPC dialogue via LLM** | ⚠️ TODO | 3d | | 4.1, 2.14 | Connect LLM output → dialogue UI. Per-NPC memory. Action extraction. |
| 4.3 | **Behavior trees/Utility AI** | ⚠️ TODO | 3d | | — | Evaluate big-brain vs bevy_behave. Pre-built templates: idle, patrol, wander, guard. |
| 4.4 | **NPC patrol existing** | 🔍 AUDIT | 1d | | — | `gen_add_npc` with `behavior: patrol` + `patrol_points` exists. Need to verify: NPC actually moves along waypoints |
| 4.5 | **Procedural IK animation** | ⚠️ TODO | 3d | | — | `bevy_mod_inverse_kinematics` for foot placement. Procedural idle (breathing, weight shift). |
| 4.6 | **AI music generation** | ⚠️ TODO | 3d | | — | ACE-Step v1.5 as localhost microservice. Content-addressed cache. |
| 4.7 | **AI SFX generation** | ⚠️ TODO | 2d | | — | Stable Audio Open for SFX. Provider fallback: local → cloud → stock. |

## 3. Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Chose | Over | Why |
|------|----------|-------|------|-----|
| 2026-03-21 | Document generation strategy | 7 docs, JIT generation | Generate all 7 upfront | Phase specs depend on decisions made during earlier phases |
| | First coding session approach | Build audit (enable physics, compile, test) | Start implementing new features | Codebase has more scaffolding than expected — need to know actual state |
| 2026-03-22 | Avian version pin | **Avian 0.6 crates.io** | Avian 0.5 | 0.6 released 2026-03-16 on crates.io. bevy-tnua-avian3d 0.11 shipped same day with full support. All target Bevy 0.18. |
| 2026-03-22 | Default build: physics | **ON by default** | OFF (opt-in) | Gen mode needs physics for player, colliders, triggers. Non-physics path is degraded experience. |
| 2026-03-22 | Character controller crate | **bevy-tnua 0.30** | bevy_ahoy, custom | tnua already in codebase, 0.30 supports Avian 0.6 via bevy-tnua-avian3d 0.11. Mature, serializable configs. |
| 2026-03-22 | Avatar/Player unification | **Three-mode CameraMode** (Option A+) | Merge into single system | Keep both systems. Gate with run conditions. `CameraMode::Player` for physics char, `Attached` for avatar, `FreeFly` for spectator. Tab cycles. Minimal code churn, maximum flexibility. |
| 2026-03-22 | Auto-collider approach | **Reactive system** (`Added<ParametricShape>`) | Inline in spawn functions | Follows existing terrain pattern. Single insertion point covers all spawn paths. glTF gets separate trimesh system. |

### Pending Decisions

| Decision | Options | Factors | Target Date |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Noclip toggle (N key) | (A) Disable Avian collision on player. (B) Switch to FreeFly temporarily. | N key currently unmapped. Need to decide if noclip is transform-based or physics-based. | Phase 1 in-engine test |

---

## 4. Risk Register

| # | Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Status | Mitigation |
|---|------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| R1 | Avian 0.6 not compatible with current bevy-tnua version | High | Medium | ✅ RETIRED | bevy-tnua-avian3d 0.11 released same day as Avian 0.6. Full compatibility confirmed. 376 tests pass. |
| R2 | Two avatar systems create conflicting input/camera handling | High | High | ✅ RETIRED | Three-mode CameraMode with exclusive run conditions. Player systems only run in Player mode. Zero input conflicts. |
| R3 | Generated primitives lack colliders → player falls through world | High | Medium | ✅ RETIRED | `auto_collider_system` for ParametricShape (11 variants). `gltf_mesh_collider_system` for loaded meshes. Ground plane has ParametricShape. All paths covered. |
| R4 | Bevy version mismatch between plugins | Medium | Medium | ✅ RETIRED | avian3d 0.6, bevy-tnua 0.30, bevy-tnua-avian3d 0.11, bevy_egui 0.39 — all target Bevy 0.18. Clean compile. |
| R5 | Terrain height estimation inaccurate → objects float or sink | Medium | High | KNOWN | No `query_terrain_height(x,z)` tool. Manual Y offset estimation. Workaround: spawn high + gravity drop. `QueryTerrainHeight` command already in commands.rs. |
| R6 | Audio assets not CC0 compliant → legal risk for distribution | Medium | Low | OPEN | Verify every asset from freesound.org. Document license per file. |
| R7 | Web viewer (Three.js) can't faithfully reproduce Bevy materials | Medium | Medium | OPEN | PBR mapping is standard. Custom shaders (wind, water) need Three.js equivalents. |
| R8 | bevy_hanabi particles incompatible with current Bevy version | Low | Medium | OPEN | Check version. Fallback: manual particle system with instanced meshes. |

## 5. Session Log

Track what happened each session. This is the journal that prevents losing context between coding days.

### Session Template

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — Session N

**Goal:** What I planned to work on
**Accomplished:**
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2

**Decisions made:**
- Decision X: chose Y because Z

**Blockers discovered:**
- Blocker description

**Next session plan:**
- First thing to do
- Second thing to do
```

### 2026-03-21 — Session 0 (Planning)

**Goal:** Create implementation tracker and Phase 1 RFC
**Accomplished:**
- [x] Reviewed full codebase via project knowledge search
- [x] Discovered extensive P1-P5 scaffolding already in place
- [x] Created Doc 0 (this document)
- [x] Created Doc 1 (RFC-Avatar-Physics-Integration)

**Key discovery:** Codebase has dual avatar/player systems, full MCP tool handlers, physics behind feature flag, spring-arm camera with collision avoidance. Much more built out than research docs implied.

**Decisions made:**
- First coding session = build audit, not greenfield implementation

**Next session plan:**
1. Enable `physics` feature flag, attempt full compile
2. Run gen mode, call `gen_spawn_player` via MCP, observe what happens
3. Resolve avatar.rs ↔ player.rs conflict (Decision: unification approach)
4. Test collision: spawn primitives, walk into them

### 2026-03-21 — Session 1 (State Reconciliation)

**Goal:** Reconcile Doc 0 with actual codebase completion status, prepare for Phase 1 build audit

**Key discovery:** Cross-referencing `docs/world/gap/TODO-START.md` reveals far more completion than Doc 0 reflects:
- **World gap specs**: 76 of 83 specs DONE (92%), 7 scaffolded (awaiting external services)
- **P0 Inspector**: 8/8 DONE — toggle, outliner tree, detail panel, world info, 3D selection, WebSocket, SwiftUI, Android
- **P1 Avatar**: 5/5 tools DONE — `gen_spawn_player`, `gen_set_spawn_point`, `gen_add_npc`, `gen_set_npc_dialogue`, `gen_set_camera_mode`
- **P2 Interaction**: 5/5 tools DONE — `gen_add_trigger`, `gen_add_teleporter`, `gen_add_collectible`, `gen_add_door`, `gen_link_entities`
- **P3 Terrain**: 5/5 tools DONE + bonus `gen_query_terrain_height`
- **P4 UI**: 5/5 tools DONE — sign, hud, label, tooltip, notification
- **P5 Physics**: 5/5 tools DONE — physics, collider, joint, force, gravity
- **Runtime Gaps**: 24/24 ALL DONE — MCP tool components now have full Bevy runtime systems
- **WG1-WG7**: ALL DONE — blockout, navmesh, hierarchical placement, evaluation, editing, decomposition, depth preview
- **Headless pipeline**: 25/31 specs DONE (81%), 6 remaining need live integration

**Reframing Phase 1:** Given this, Phase 1 is NOT "implement avatar/physics." It is:
1. **Verify** that existing P1/P5 scaffolding compiles and runs with physics feature
2. **Unify** the dual avatar.rs / player.rs systems (Doc 1, Section 2)
3. **Wire up** collider auto-insertion on spawned geometry
4. **Polish** movement feel (Tnua config, camera smoothing)

**Parallel workstream — Headless completion:**
6 remaining headless specs (H1.5.2 offscreen camera, H1.5.4-5 screenshot pipeline, H2.5 heartbeat dispatch, H3.5-6 memory, H4.4 thumbnails, H5.5 experiment processor) should be tracked alongside Phase 1.

**Parallel workstream — Long-term architecture:**
Four goal documents in `todo-gen/goal/` define the multi-year vision:
- MMO-scale spatial sharding via SpacetimeDB (BitCraft pattern)
- Multi-scale universe (planetary to galactic via `big_space`)
- Governance, permissions, content quality scoring
- AI ecosystems, time archaeology, emergent civilizations
These inform but don't block Phase 1-4. Current phased approach correctly builds the foundation.

**Decisions made:**
- Doc 0 Phase 1 status reframed from "implement" to "verify + unify + wire + polish"
- Headless pipeline tracked as parallel workstream
- Goal docs reviewed — no changes needed to Phase 1-4 plan

**Next session plan:**
1. Build audit: `cargo build --features physics` in localgpt
2. Agent teams: avatar/player code audit, physics feature audit, collision audit

### 2026-03-22 — Session 2 (Implementation Sprint)

**Goal:** Execute Phase 1 build audit, upgrade physics, add colliders, unify avatar/player systems

**Accomplished:**
- [x] Upgraded avian3d 0.5→0.6, bevy-tnua-avian3d 0.2→0.11 (all target Bevy 0.18)
- [x] Fixed 16 avian3d/bevy-tnua API breaking changes across 5 files
- [x] Enabled physics feature by default (`default = ["physics"]`)
- [x] Added `auto_collider_system` — reactive system mapping 11 ParametricShape variants to Avian colliders
- [x] Added `gltf_mesh_collider_system` — trimesh colliders for loaded glTF meshes
- [x] Added ParametricShape to ground plane for auto-collider
- [x] Exposed 5 physics MCP tools: `gen_set_physics`, `gen_add_collider`, `gen_add_joint`, `gen_add_force`, `gen_set_gravity`
- [x] Implemented three-mode CameraMode (FreeFly/Attached/Player) with exclusive run conditions
- [x] Gated PlayerPlugin and CameraPlugin with `in_player_mode` run condition
- [x] `gen_spawn_player` now auto-switches to Player mode
- [x] Tab key correctly cycles Player↔FreeFly (prefers Player over Attached when player exists)
- [x] Verified: 376 tests pass, zero compile errors, zero warnings in changed files
- [x] Confirmed `respawn_player_system` already exists (KillPlane y=-50, SpawnPoint lookup)
- [x] Updated Doc 0: Phase 1 dashboard (8/10 done), Decision Log (6 decisions), Risk Register (R1-R4 retired)

**Files changed (10):**
- `crates/gen/Cargo.toml` — deps + features
- `crates/gen/src/physics/collider.rs` — auto_collider_system, gltf_mesh_collider_system
- `crates/gen/src/physics/joint.rs` — avian3d 0.6 API migration
- `crates/gen/src/physics/force.rs` — ExternalForce→Forces
- `crates/gen/src/character/player.rs` — bevy-tnua 0.30 migration + in_player_mode gate
- `crates/gen/src/character/camera.rs` — SpatialQueryFilter borrow + in_player_mode gate
- `crates/gen/src/gen3d/avatar.rs` — CameraMode::Player variant, in_player_mode, Tab toggle update
- `crates/gen/src/gen3d/plugin.rs` — ground plane ParametricShape, SpawnPlayer→Player mode
- `crates/gen/src/gen3d/tools.rs` — 5 physics MCP tool implementations

**Risks retired:** R1 (Avian compat), R2 (avatar conflict), R3 (missing colliders), R4 (Bevy mismatch)

**Next session plan:**
1. In-engine test: `cargo run -p localgpt-gen`, call `gen_spawn_player` via MCP, verify player moves
2. In-engine test: spawn primitives, walk into them, verify collision
3. Polish movement feel: tune Tnua acceleration/deceleration, camera smoothing
4. Consider Phase 2 readiness: trigger volumes, ambient audio prep
